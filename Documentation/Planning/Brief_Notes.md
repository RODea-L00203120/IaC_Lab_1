# CloudFormation

Learning Outcomes - 

 1. Engage in practitioner-based research to compose solutions to deployment pipeline efficiency issues
		- Implies identification of pipeline efficiency issues through exploratory and practically applied research


 2. Conceptualise, research and critique techniques and technologies to automate processes and job lifecycles 
		 - Implies critical thinking demonstration in relation to IaC automation tools during SDC
		 - Exploratory research required
		
 3. Undertake an analysis of incomplete, incorrect or contradictory solutions to a problems communicate in a professional manner an alternative approach underpinned by justifications informed by clearly articulated research.
		 - Demonstrate problem solving and solution driven research 

 4. Critical awareness of the importance of coding best practice in disseminating information to enhance teamwork.
		 - Research, determine and define best practices
		 - 
 5. Analyse the impact of scripted pipelines on enhancing team work in delivering software across a pipeline.
		 - Evidence based sources - discuss, synthesise 
 
 6. Devise a scripted solution for a software delivery pipeline including design, implementation and test phases.
		- The practical element
 
 7. Review and refactor scripts via peer-review retrospective and refinement meetings.
	 - Aim to have something to demonstrate early on - conduct self reflective and analytical reviews through out the process

Note first what AWS states about CloudFormation and lambda:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-iac.htmlwhich states: “AWS CloudFormation is the foundational IaC service from AWS. You can use YAMLor JSON templates to model and provision your entire AWS infrastructure, including Lambda functions. CloudFormation handles the complexities of creating, updating, and deleting yourAWS resources.”

- Outline the importance and purpose of CloudFormation
- Outline the purpose of lambda functions in AWS infrastructure
- Outline what, why and where it can be integrated and used to improve aspects of the DevOps pipeline
	- Does it provide - Consistency & Reproducibility?
	- Idempotency; Modularity & Reusability?
	- Testability; Security, Maintainability?  


## Part A: Long question 1. 
	
Create a lambda - restful api using cloudformation so as to understand how CloudFormation can be used to support such structures. 

Provided Tutorials: 

 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-request-validation-sample-cloudformation.html

 https://rino-dev.com/build-and-deploy-rest-api-on-aws

1) declare the tutorial you have followed, 
2) take the work to the next level by changing the code to improve it or change the features.

## Part B: Best practices 

1. Consider best practices when creating your sample code
	- Requires defining best practices.
2. Apply power tools where appropriate
	- Python package looks good.
3. Consider ‘ilities’ – security, scalability, performance
	- Research should contribute to this.
