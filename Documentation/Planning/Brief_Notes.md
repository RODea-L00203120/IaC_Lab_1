		- Implies identification of pipeline efficiency issues through exploratory and practically applied research


 2. Conceptualise, research and critique techniques and technologies to automate processes and job lifecycles 
		 - Implies critical thinking demonstration in relation to IaC automation tools during SDC
		 - Exploratory research required
		
 3. Undertake an analysis of incomplete, incorrect or contradictory solutions to a problems communicate in a professional manner an alternative approach underpinned by justifications informed by clearly articulated research.

 4. Critical awareness of the importance of coding best practice in disseminating information to enhance teamwork.
		 - Research, determine and define best practices
		 - 
 5. Analyse the impact of scripted pipelines on enhancing team work in delivering software across a pipeline.
		 - Evidence based sources - discuss, synthesise 
 
 6. Devise a scripted solution for a software delivery pipeline including design, implementation and test phases.
		- The practical element
 
 7. Review and refactor scripts via peer-review retrospective and refinement meetings.
	 - Aim to have something to demonstrate early on - conduct self reflective and analytical reviews through out the process
